Game is a native workspace that contains a basic architecture for game development on iOS, OSX and tvOS. That allows the developer to share code between these platforms

##Coding Style
We are following the [Github's swift style guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) 

##Clean code
Please remember this points every time you write code

* Bad code does too much – Clean code is focused
* The language you wrote your code with should look like it was made for the problem
* It should not be redundant
* Reading your code should be pleasant
* Can be easily extended by any other developer
* It should have minimal dependencies
* Smaller is better
* It should be expressive
* Use descriptive variable names
* Never Cut-and-paste code
* Omit needless code!
